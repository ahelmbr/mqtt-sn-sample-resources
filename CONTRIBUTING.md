##Public Participation Invited

This [OASIS TC Open Repository](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories) ( https://github.com/oasis-open/mqtt-sn-sample-resources ) is a community public repository that supports participation by anyone, whether affiliated with OASIS or not.  Substantive contributions and related feedback is invited from all parties, following the common conventions for participation in GitHub public repository projects.  Participation is expected to be consistent with the [OASIS TC Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), the [LICENSE](LICENSE) designated for this particular repository (Apache-2.0), and the requirement for an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/oasis-open/mqtt-sn-sample-resources). Please see the repository [README](https://github.com/oasis-open/mqtt-sn-sample-resources/blob/master/README.md) for other details.

## Governance Distinct from OASIS TC Process

Content accepted as contributions to this Open Repository, as defined below, are distinct from any [contributions](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#contributions) made to the [MQTT TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=mqtt) itself. Participation in MQTT is governed by the [OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process) and [IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), and other related [policies](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/).  This Open Repository is not subject to the OASIS TC-related policies.  The Open Repository governance is defined by the [Open Repositories Overview](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories).

## Licensing Distinct from OASIS IPR Policy

Because different licenses apply to the OASIS TC's specification work, and this TC Open Repository, there is no guarantee that the licensure of specific repository material will be compatible with licensing requirements of an implementation of a TC's specification.  Please refer to the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the terms of this material, and to the OASIS IPR Policy for [Non-Assertion Mode](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#Non-Assertion-Mode), the terms applicable to the TC's specifications, including any applicable [declarations](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/mqtt/ipr.php).

## Contributions Subject to Individual CLA

Formally, a contribution to this Open Repository refers to content merged into the repository. Anyone who signs the Open Repository [Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://cla-assistant.io/oasis-open/mqtt-sn-sample-resources), signifying agreement with the licensing requirement, may contribute substantive content subject to evaluation of a GitHub pull request.  The main web page for this repository, as with any GitHub public repository, displays a link to a document listing contributions to the repository's default branch (filtered by Commits, Additions, and Deletions).

This TC Open Repository, as with GitHub public repositories generally, also accepts public feedback from any GitHub user.  Public feedback includes opening issues, authoring and editing comments, participating in conversations, making wiki edits, creating repository stars, and making suggestions via pull requests.  Such feedback does not constitute an Open Repository contribution.
